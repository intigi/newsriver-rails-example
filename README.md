# Intigi News River Example App

This example app powers news.intigi.com and demonstrates how the Intigi API can be used.

# Setting Up

## API Key

You will need to obtain a key from Intigi and set this variable with your key:

* ENV['INTIGI_API_KEY']

## Authentication

This app uses a very basic authentication method and relies on the following two environment variables. For serious production environments you should set up a proper authentication system.

* ENV['INTIGI_RIVERS_USERNAME']
* ENV['INTIGI_RIVERS_PASSWORD']

## Embedly API

This app will fetch image previews and excerpts from embedly but you need to install your embedly API key.

* ENV['EMBEDLY_API_KEY']

## Heroku Setup

$ heroku config:add INTIGI_API_KEY=yourapikey INTIGI_RIVERS_USERNAME=yourusername INTIGI_RIVERS_PASSWORD=yourpassword EMBEDLY_API_KEY=yourembedlyapikey

Check your variables using:

$ heroku config

And you should see something like:

=== intigi-news Config Vars
INTIGI_API_KEY:         yourapikey
INTIGI_RIVERS_PASSWORD: yourusername
INTIGI_RIVERS_USERNAME: yourpassword

## Development Setup

Edit your ~/.bashrc to include the environment variables so you can test in development:

export INTIGI_API_KEY=yourapikey
export INTIGI_RIVERS_USERNAME=yourusername
export INTIGI_RIVERS_PASSWORD=yourpassword
export EMBEDLY_API_KEY=yourembedlyapikey
